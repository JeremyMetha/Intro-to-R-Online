Our focus is on researchers teaching researcherswith many of our trainers currently performing research in masters or doctoral degrees.



Due to the current public health crisis surronding the SARS-coV-2 virus, we have placed a moratorium on our face to face teaching sessions. Instead, through this page you can find self-paced, online versions of our trainings to help get you off the ground and started at analyising your data using R and RStudio!
